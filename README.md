# GANForDP
This tool uses a deep learning model "GAN" to resolve data imbalance problem occurred in machine learning data.
Users can easily get result of their datafiles in four ways of oversampling data. (one of a four way is a baseline method)
Input directory path, python exe path, GAN.py path and evaluation classifier must be set.
